Functionality: The program with main in BlockChainDriver.java allows the user to perform a variety of actions on blockchain. The blockchain consists of singular blocks that along with other blocks create a linked-structure. They each consist of (among others) nonce - a unique ID used for mining of hash - an array of bytes generated based on the data and nonce input. All of the components of this program are built in either class, depending on their level of complexity.
